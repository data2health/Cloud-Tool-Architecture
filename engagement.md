Project 1- Cloud Architecture: Outreach, Engagement, and Education Plan

For the purposes of the interaction between Project 1 (cloud architecture) and Projects 3 and 4 (pilot deployment of “cloudified” applications), we will implement a multi-part outreach, engagement, and education plan, consisting of the following activities:

•	The cloud architecture team at WashU will conduct regularly scheduled and virtual “technical stand up meetings” with the teams developing and providing access to the applications to be “cloudified”;
•	The project manager at WashU will generate a shared project charter for each “cloudification” effort, outlining: 1) project objectives; 2) technical deliverables; 3) timelines; 3) communications plans (beyond the preceding “technical stand up meeting”); and 4) risk management plans.  These charters will be considered “living” documents (hosted in the CD2H Git Repository) and updated on a regular basis to reflect project milestones, achievements, and other relevant developments.
•	During the course of the “cloudification” projects, we will also generate and regularly update a set of technical best practice documents and associated workflow and RACI models, focusing on the technology deployment process for both Virtual Server and SaaS solutions that are being containerized and deployed in the NCATS cloud environment.  These documents will be made available in a curated manner via the Guidebook, but also in a dynamic manner via the CD2H Git Repository.
•	On a regularly occurring basis (at least bi-monthly, and more frequently based upon demand), the cloud architecture team at WashU will host a cloud deployment “tools of the trade” webinar, which will be open to all CTSA hubs, and which will highlight recent activities of the team as well as the aforementioned technical best practice documents and findings.  Similarly, a slack channel for CTSA hub affiliates interested or engaged in cloud architecture and deployment will be established to enable asynchronous communication in-between such webinars.
•	Finally, the cloud architecture team at WashU will engage in regular environmental scanning of the IDTF and broader CTSA community to identify future opportunities for “cloudification” projects.  Simultaneously, the team will also engage in broader scanning to identify and report back to interested individuals (via the above mechanisms) on emergent cloud computing and architectural models and frameworks that may impact the work of the CD2H and broader CTSA communities.
