Project 1- Cloud Architecture: Development and Publication of Technical Best Practices and Standards

In a manner analogous to the aforementioned outreach, engagement, and educational activities, the cloud architecture team at WashU will also engage in a process of iterative development and publication of technical best practices and standards related to the quality, documentation, and development lifecycle management of software products intended for deployment in the NCATS cloud environment.  These documents and standards will be generated concomitant with the technical deliverables and tasks associated with this Project as well as Projects 3 and 4, so as to be anchored in those practical deployment activities.  Specific frameworks to be used to inform the generation of these documents and standards will include (but are not limited to):

•	ISO/IEC/IEEE 15289 (2017): Systems and software engineering – content of life-cycle information products (documentation).  This standard specifies a minimum information content for software documentation from several perspectives:
o	Purpose and common content for typical information items (generic types)
o	Specific content needed for various life-cycle processes
o	Types of data collected and used
•	ISO/IEC 26513 (2009): Systems and software engineering - requirements for testers.  This standard focuses on the development of systematized plans for software testing throughout the development lifecycle. The standard specifies the documentation need for verification and validation at the unit level, as well as processes for managing the output of reviews, and resolving problems discovered during reviews and tests. 

These documents will be made available in a curated manner via the Guidebook, but also in a dynamic manner via the CD2H Git Repository.  Further, they will be subject to comment, feedback, and stakeholder approval via the “Tools of the Trade” sessions described in the outreach, engagement, and educational plan.
