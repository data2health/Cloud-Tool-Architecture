# Cloud-Tool-Architecture

TBD

## Problem statement

This portal aims to  

## Project description
Define and document a cloud deployment workflow that can be used by all CD2H sites to guide deploying applications and tools in the NCATS cloud. 
We will deploy a CD2H branded GitLab instance in the CD2H cloud.  This has a dual benefit, first we will use the creation of the NCATS-CD2H GitLab as a working/learning experience that directly feeds information into creating the deployment workflow mentioned prior.   Second, the cloud based GitLab will provide a location for other CD2H sites to create repositories.    Both AWS and Docker GitLab instances are planned.
In addition we will deploy the Mortality Prediction app code and documentation into the CD2H Gitlab. A Docker container will also be created as a sandbox environment for the Mortality Prediction app. Lessons learned in the Mortality Prediction deployment will be used to enhance the deployment workflow. 
Deployment of an NLP application into the NCATS cloud using the documented deployment workflow is also planned as part of this project. 

 

## Contact person

We require a contact person for each project for administrative purposes. Each project should also have a CD2H Program director assigned.

## Deliverables

Creation of a GitLab instance deployed in the NCATS cloud.  (Dependant on GitLab being selected as the Git repo) 
A successful deployment of the Mortality-Prediction application in the NCATS cloud.
A successful deployment of an NLP application in the NCATS cloud.
Creation of an authetication process that can be used by all CD2H sites.
Creation off a Guidebook/workflow documentation that other CD2H teams can follow to deploy their apps/algorythms/tools to the CD2H cloud.

## Milestones

The milestones for this project is here:

https://github.com/data2health/Cloud-Tool-Archtecture/milestones

We are still in the process of finalizing them.

## Evaluation
Each project should propose a set of evaluation measures, recorded in a separate Evaluation Plan file, for example [here](https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/blob/master/evaluation.md). These will be reviewed by the Evaluation committee and approved by the Program Directors and NCATS. The Evaluation committee will meet with each Project team leads to assist. 

Each project should have Evaluation-realated issues, that can be tagged with the "evaluation" tag. see [Example Evaluation Issue](https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/issues/5)

## Education
Each project should propose a set of educational activities, listed separately in the Education Plan file. 
Please reference any of the following that apply: 
- Educational resources that will be generated (these can be milestones and/or files in the repo)
- Educational opportunities (please indicate for which type of learner and how to participate)
- Best practices guides

Please include education related issues where relevant, tagged with "education". 

## Get involved
We encourage the community to get involved. 

We require all CD2H projects to have non-CD2H CTSA participants, as CD2H is a CTSA coordinating center. Each project should include an Engagement plan file, example [here](https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/blob/master/engagement.md). 

Please tag any engagment related issues with "engagement".

## Working documents
Documentation may be natively in GitHub using the wiki or .md files in the appropriate folder, or in Google Drive.
